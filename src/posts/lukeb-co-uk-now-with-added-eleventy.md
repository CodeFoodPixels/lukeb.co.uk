Ever since I gave [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev/) a go when I was building the [LeedsJS](https://leedsjs.com) website, I've been a huge fan and advocate, even convincing some people to give it a try out of my sheer enthusiasm for it. I absolutely love the simplicity and flexibility of it, as well as things like data files. I have a whole post talking about this stuff from when I was [building the new LeedsJS website](/blog/2019/11/11/building-the-new-leedsjs-website/).

I've been meaning to convert my own site over for a while, and recently took the plunge and decided to do it. As well as giving me the opportunity to dig into Eleventy without a deadline pressing me, it also gave me the chance to make some stylistic changes.
