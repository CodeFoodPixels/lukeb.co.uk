Today is [CSS naked day 2020](https://css-naked-day.github.io/)! Inspired by [Eric Meyer](https://meyerweb.com/), [Laura Kalbag](https://laurakalbag.com/css-naked-day-2020/) and [Andy Bell](https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/css-naked-day-2020/), I've removed the CSS from my site for today.

The process for me was super easy! Because my HTML was already well structured and I had decent default sizes for my images, I just had to remove the links to the CSS files and it worked!
