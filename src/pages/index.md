I'm a self-taught web developer/software engineer with expertise in building scalable, performant websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as a myriad of other technologies. Currently I live near Ayr, Scotland and work for [AND Digital](https://and.digital/), but have previously worked for [Frog Education](https://www.frogeducation.com/) and [Sky Betting & Gaming](https://www.skybetcareers.com/).

I'm an experienced public speaker, having spoken at multiple international conferences, meetups and other events on topics such as home automation, Web Bluetooth and creative coding. I previously lived near Leeds, where I organised and hosted the [LeedsJS](https://leedsjs.com) community group since April 2016.

Outside of tech, my other big passion is food and cooking. I enjoy trying different recipes and techniques, as well as learning to use new ingredients.

I also enjoy pixel art and will occasionally post pieces to Twitter.
